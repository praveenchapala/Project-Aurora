# 🌍 Business Context

Project Aurora is an open-source learning platform that enables educators, creators, organizations, and learners to manage digital education through a unified platform.

The platform provides capabilities for course creation, enrollment, content delivery, assessments, learner progress tracking, certificates, analytics, and platform administration.

Aurora is designed with a modular architecture to support future scalability while initially focusing on independent educators and students.
